Pipeline can be many things ranging from Tasks, DCC's and Tools, but personally I find it that at its core, Pipeline is mostly about the flow of data, and its main building blocks are just a bunch of processes with inputs and outputs (Loaders and Publishers)

While Pipeline diagrams can be made out from any diagraming software, there is none that comes with certain preconfigured concepts from our industry, and I also think that Node networks are the best way to represet that idea of "a bunch of processes with inputs and outputs"

What if there is a tool that offers:
- An editable Node network similar to those from all the DCC's that we use all  day.
- Pre-configured with all the known standard formats used in the industry as inputs and outputs.
- Automatic layout of the network, usefull when things get really big an complex.
- Interactive navigation and preview of isolated parts of the network.
- Store documentation of process and its inputs and outputs.

All that is what Plumber Manager its aming to offer.
